# 🌟 Setting Up and Running the React App Locally 🌟

To run the React app on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Follow these steps to get everything up and running:

## Prerequisites 🛠️

- Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Steps to Set Up the React App 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the Zip Folder** 📦
   - If you have a Git repository, clone it using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the zip folder from the repository hosting service and extract it to a local directory.

2. **Open the Folder Location** 📂
   - Navigate to the folder containing the project files using your command line interface (CLI) of choice.

3. **Navigate to the `frontend` Directory** 📁
   - Change to the `frontend` directory where the project dependencies are defined:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

4. **Install the Project Dependencies** 🛠️
   - Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. **Run the Development Server** 🌐
   - To start a locally served version of the application, use:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

6. **Modifying the Project** ✏️
   - Once the development server is running, you can start modifying the project. Any changes you make will be reflected in the browser.


Happy coding! 🎉
